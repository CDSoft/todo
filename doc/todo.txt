Todo plugin for Vim:

This Vim plugin is based on vim-task (github.com/samsonw/vim-task).
It helps managing todo lists within Vim in a very basic but efficient way.

The latest version of todo can be found here: cdelord.fr/todo

Contributions are possible on GitHub: https://github.com/CDSoft.fr/todo

Installation:

    Todo is distributed as a Vimball archive.
    + download todo.vmb
    + open this file with vim and type « :so % »

Usage:

    File type:

    ✓ file named *.todo or *todo.txt are open with the todo plugin.

    Syntax:

    ✓ lines ending with ':' are project titles
    + lines starting with '+' are urgent tasks
    - lines starting with '-' are pending tasks (less urgent)
    ✓ lines starting with '✓' are completed tasks
    ? lines starting with '?' are questions
    Some "todo" words are highlighted
    Other lines remain unformated

    Shortcuts:

    Shortcuts are key sequences starting with <Leader>. The <Leader> key is
    '\' by default but I personnally prefer '²' which makes Todo shortcuts
    easier to type on a french keyboard.
    You can add « let mapleader="²" » to the .vimrc file or define any
    other key that suits you best.

    ✓ \TAB toggles the line status between "pending" and "completed"
    ✓ \& toggles the line status between "urgent" and "completed"
    ✓ \q toggles the line status between "question" and "unformated"
